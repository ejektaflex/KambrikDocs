As such, autocompletion features are important when it comes to writing code. Kambrik attempts to use method names that enable discovery of new methods, as well as extension methods. For example, when typing <code>text</code>, you will see the options for:</p><ul><li><code>textLiteral</code></li><li><code>textTranslate</code></li><li><code>textKeybind</code></li></ul><p>All possibilities are brought to your attention with autocomplete alone, saving you time and logically grouping similar functions together. Another place we do this is within Command DSLs, where typing <code>arg</code> might give you:</p><ul><li><code>argString</code></li><li><code>argInt</code></li><li><code>argIdentifier</code></li><li><code>argBlockpos</code></li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>Common method naming schemes make writing new code faster, and remove some of the guesswork when it comes to using a new library.</p><h3 id="write-for-readability" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#write-for-readability" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Write for Readability</h3><p>Code should be readable and understandable. Methods should clearly describe what they are doing when possible. When impossible, they should be documented/annotated.</p><p>Docs and wikis, like this website itself, should not focus on documenting methods and properties, but instead focus on explaining how to use them together. If the method name must be verbose to express it&#39;s own purpose, then so be it.</p><h3 id="write-sensible-dsls" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#write-sensible-dsls" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Write Sensible DSLs</h3><p>Kotlin developers love DSLs, but they tend to start turning every Java builder that exists into one. Most times, you can take a Java builder object and use <code>builder.apply { /* ... */ }</code> to achieve the same result without creating a builder.</p><p>Kambrik uses a DSL structure where it makes sense, but not wherever possible.</p>',14);i.render=function(e,i){return t};export{i as default};
