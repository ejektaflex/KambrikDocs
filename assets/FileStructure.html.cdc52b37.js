In the config folder, you will find two subfolders:</p><ul><li><code>bounty_decrees</code></li><li><code>bounty_pools</code></li></ul><p>Just like with data packs, you can create Pools and Decrees, and add them here. However, unlike data packs, you do not need to create a subfolder for each mod you are adding compatibility for, since we are modifying the pool and decree data after it has already been loaded.</p><p>E.g.:</p><div class="language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-text"><code>config\n    bountiful\n        bounty_pools\n            - new_pool.json\n            - toolsmith.json\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span><br><span class="line-number">2</span><br><span class="line-number">3</span><br><span class="line-number">4</span><br><span class="line-number">5</span><br></div></div><p>By default, adding a new file will <strong>add</strong> all of the file&#39;s elements into the game data. If you instead wish to <strong>replace</strong> the datapack/game data with your config data, you can add <code>&quot;replace&quot;: true</code> to the top of your file&#39;s json object.</p><h2 id="removing-content" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#removing-content" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Removing Content</h2><p>If you want to remove certain decrees and pools from the game, Bountiful&#39;s config allows you to specify certain datapack/game data files which you would like to exclude from loading. For example:</p><ul><li><code>bounty_pools/bountiful/*</code> will exclude all Bountiful pools from loading</li><li><code>bounty_pools/*</code> will exclude all pools from loading</li><li><code>bounty_*</code> or just <code>*</code> would exclude all pools and decrees from loading</li></ul><p>There is currently no way of removing specific entries from a given pool.</p><h2 id="localizing-content" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#localizing-content" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Localizing Content</h2><p>Some content (namely, decrees or objectives/rewards with custom translation keys) may require you to contribute a localization to the game. This can be done via a resource pack. If you&#39;d like a more simple approach, then something such as Open Loader (mentioned above) will also work wonderfully.</p>',13);s.render=function(i,l){const s=e("OutboundLink");return a(),o(r,null,[d,c,u,h,p,n("p",null,[f,n("a",m,[g,t(s)]),b,n("a",w,[y,t(s)]),k]),n("p",null,[v,n("a",x,[_,t(s)]),j]),I],64)};export{s as default};
