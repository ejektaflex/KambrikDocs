# Reputation

Reputation is a stat attached to all Bounty Boards in Bountiful. As players turn in more
bounties to the bounty board, their reputation increases. In turn, higher levels of
reputation will increase the frequency of rare items to show up in bounties. For example,
starting at reputation level 5, all Uncommon rewards are twice as likely to show up in
the Bounty Board!

Additionally, players receive a discount at any bounty board where they have accrued some
reputation, scaling with the reputation level of the bounty board.
