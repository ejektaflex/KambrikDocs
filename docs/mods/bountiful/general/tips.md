# Tips

Bountiful has a few hidden features - we'll list most of them here for your reference! Some features may only apply to newer versions of Bountiful.

### Composting

Bounties and Decrees can be composted in a Composter.

### Combining Decrees

Decrees can be combined in an Anvil, allowing you to effectively put more than three Decrees on one board at a time.

### Villager Experience

In the newest versions of Bountiful, a Villager will walk to the Bounty Board (if they are not occupied with something else) and 'collect' the objectives that you submitted to the board. This gives them a little bit of trade experience.
