# Built-in Commands

Kambrik offers a command for developers to view registry and tag information more easily.


## Dump

`/kambrik dump` is used to dump information about the game to the log.

There are several variations:

* `/kambrik dump registry (registry_name)`
> Dumps the given registry content to the log.

// TODO reimplement this
* `/kambrik dump tags (blocks/entity_types/fluids/game_events/items) [id]`
> Dumps the given tags of the given type to the log. You can optionally restrict
> the results to a given tag ID, if desired.
